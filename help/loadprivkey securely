The private key for utilizing transactions should be kept secure and not stored in a configuration file or any other plain text file. Storing private keys in plain text files can compromise the security of your BEP20 token and result in theft or loss of tokens.

Instead, you should use a secure method to manage your private keys, such as a hardware wallet or a secure key management system. You can use a library like web3.py to interact with your BEP20 token contract and sign transactions using the private key securely.

In your main.py script or wherever you need to interact with the BEP20 token contract, you can use the web3.py library to load your private key and interact with the blockchain. Here's a code snippet to give you an idea:

python
Copy code
from web3 import Web3, HTTPProvider
from web3.auto import w3

private_key = "0x123456789abcdef..." # replace with your private key
contract_address = "0x123456789abcdef..." # replace with your BEP20 token contract address

w3.eth.default_account = w3.eth.account.privateKeyToAccount(private_key)

contract = w3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)

# interact with the contract using the methods provided by the `contract` object
In the code above, private_key is the private key associated with the Ethereum account that has the tokens. contract_address is the address of the BEP20 token contract, and abi is the contract's Application Binary Interface.

Remember to keep your private key safe and secure to prevent unauthorized access to your BEP20 tokens.
